## *Monty - Stack and Queue Interpreter*

Monty is a simple interpreter for the Monty scripting language, which operates on stacks and queues. This project was
created as part of the ALX School curriculum to demonstrate understanding of data structures and low-level programming
concepts in C.

### *About Monty*

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes. It relies on a unique stack, with
specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Monty byte code files typically have the .m extension and contain a series of instructions, one per line. The Monty
interpreter reads these files and executes the specified operations, manipulating the stack or queue data structure
accordingly.
